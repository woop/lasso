# Lasso

A JSON reverse proxy that simplifies the interaction with multiple microservices in a distributed system. Lasso allows you to consolidate API endpoints and reduce the complexity of accessing them.

## Use Case

In a distributed system with multiple microservices, a front-end application can face difficulties managing multiple endpoints. Lasso comes in handy by providing a single entry point to these services, making it easier to maintain and reducing the need for multiple API calls.

## Example

Consider a system with the following microservices:

1. Authentication Service
2. User Management Service
3. Billing Service
4. Product Catalog Service

By deploying Lasso as a reverse proxy, the front-end application can interact with a single Lasso endpoint, which forwards the requests to the corresponding microservices.
